1. list and array are both similiar to each other. Both are mutable menas they can expand or shrink in size. Also both are fast in performance.
2. The main difference between list and array is, array stores data of only single data type where as list can store data of multiple data types.
3. unlike list, array is not built-in data structure. so to use array, we have to import array module..

4. There are three ways to import an array:
method 1:
import array
array.array()

method 2:
import array as arr
arr.array()

method 3:
from array import *
array()

5.Now after importing an array, we have to define it.
Syntax:
variable_name = array(typecode,[element])

Typecode:
TYPECODE	C TYPE	PYTHON TYPE	SIZE
'b'	signed char	int	1
'B'	unsigned char	int	1
'u'	wchar_t	Unicode character	2
'h'	signed short	int	2
'H'	unsigned short	int	2
'i'	signed int	int	2
'I'	unsigned int	int	2
'l'	signed long	int	4
'L'	unsigned long	int	4
'q'	signed long long	int	8
'Q'	unsigned long long	int	8
'f'	float	float	4
'd'	double	float	8

Signed integer means that the array can include positive and negative values. Unsigned integer, with H for example, would mean that no negative values are allowed.

To create integer array:
arr1 = array(i,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7])

6. Array Example:
import array as arr
arr1 = arr.array(i,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
print(arr1)

o/p:
array('i', [1,2,3,4,5,6,7])

To find the length of an array:
print(len(arr1))

7. Indexing of array and how to access individual items in an array.
indexing in python starts at 0.
Each item in an array has a specific address.
Syntax:
array_name[index_value_of_item]

import array as arr
arr1 = arr.array(i,[1,2,3,4,5])
print(arr1[0])
print(arr1[3])
print(arr1[-1])  -- last element of an array
print(arr1[-2])  -- second last element of an array

8. Searching element in an array
.index() method is used to get the index number of passing element.

import array as arr
arr1 = arr.array(i,[5,6,7,5,8,9))
print(arr1.index(5))    -- will always give index of first occurance.

o/p:
0

9.Loop through an array.

printing an array without using loop.
import array as arr
arr1 = arr.array(i,[2,4,6,8])
print(arr1)
o/p:
array('i', [2,4,6,8])

printing an array values one by oone using loop.
import array as arr
arr1 = arr.array(i,[12,34,56,12])
for i in arr1:
  print(i)

o/p:
12
34
56
12

10. Slice an array.
: (colon) works as a slicing operator in python.
the counting starts from 0
import array as arr
arr2 = arr.array(i,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
print(arr2[:])    -- print array as it is. with all elements.
print(arr2[:3])   -- print array from 0th index to 2nd index.
print(arr2[1:])   -- print array from 1st index till the end.
