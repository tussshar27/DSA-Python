1. Remove duplicates from a given string.
s1 = 'geeksforgeeks'
def myfunc(s1):
  s2 = ''
  for i in s1:
    if i not in s2:
      s2 += i
    
  return s2
  
print(myfunc(s1))
print('tushar'+'annam')
output:
geksfor
tusharannam

2. Remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
s1 = "computer"
s2 = "cat"

def myfunc(s1,s2):
  s3 = ""
  for i in s1:
    if i not in s2:
      s3 += i
        
  return s3
  
print(myfunc(s1,s2))
output:
ompuer

3. Check if given strings are rotations of each other or not.
s = "abcde"
goal = "cdeab"

class Solution(object):
  
    def rotateString(self, s, goal):
      print(s in goal+goal)            #trick is to see whether the given string is present inside the goal+goal string because after rotation, it should be present inside goal+goal.
      return len(s) == len(goal) and s in goal+goal
            
obj =  Solution()
print(obj.rotateString(s,goal))
output:
True
True

4. Print all permutations of given String.

5. Reverse words in a given string.
s1 = 'geeks quiz practice code'

def myfunc(s1):
  s2 = ''
  l1 = []
  for i in s1.split():
    l1.append(i)
    
  print(l1)
  print(l1[::-1])
  s2 = ' '.join(l1[::-1])    
  print(s2)

print(myfunc(s1))
output:
['geeks', 'quiz', 'practice', 'code']
['code', 'practice', 'quiz', 'geeks']
code practice quiz geeks
