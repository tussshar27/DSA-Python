1. Python Program to Find Sum of Array.
# using global variable to access variable present outside the function
arr = {1,2,3}
sum = 0
def mysum(arr):
    global sum
    for i in arr:
        sum = sum + i
    return sum
print(mysum(arr))

#without using global variable
arr = {1,2,3}
def mysum(arr):
    sum = 0
    for i in arr:
        sum = sum + i
    return sum
print(mysum(arr))
output:
6
