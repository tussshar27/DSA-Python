1. Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
->
There are three ways to solve this question using bruteforce method which compare each value with every other value O(Nsquare), second is to first sort and compare only neighbor value and third is to insert in hashset set().
def containsDuplicate(self, num:List[int]):
    hashset = set()
    for n in num:
        if n in hashset:
            return True
        hashset.add(n)
    return False
