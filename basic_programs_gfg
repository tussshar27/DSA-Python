1. How to Add Two Numbers in Python â€“ Easy Programs
a = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))        #calling int() function because by default input() function generates string value from user.
b = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))

def addition(a,b):
    return a + b
    
print(f'1st number: {a} and 2nd number: {b} then addition of both: {addition(a,b)}')
output:
Enter 1st number: 10
Enter 2nd number: 20
1st number: 10 and 2nd number: 20 then addition of both: 30

2. Find Maximum of two numbers in Python
a = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
b = int(input("Enter 2st number: "))

def maximum(a,b):
    if a>b:
        print(f'{a} is greater than {b}')
    else:
        print(f'{b} is greater than {a}')
        
maximum(a,b)
output:
Enter 1st number: 10
Enter 2st number: 20
20 is greater than 10

=== Code Execution Successful ===

#using lambda function
a = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
b = int(input("Enter 2st number: "))

maximum = lambda a,b: a if a>b else b

print(maximum(a,b))
ouptut:
Enter 1st number: 10
Enter 2st number: 20
20
