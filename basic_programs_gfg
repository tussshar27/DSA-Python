1. How to Add Two Numbers in Python – Easy Programs
a = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))        #calling int() function because by default input() function generates string value from user.
b = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))

def addition(a,b):
    return a + b
    
print(f'1st number: {a} and 2nd number: {b} then addition of both: {addition(a,b)}')
output:
Enter 1st number: 10
Enter 2nd number: 20
1st number: 10 and 2nd number: 20 then addition of both: 30

2. Find Maximum of two numbers in Python
a = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
b = int(input("Enter 2st number: "))

def maximum(a,b):
    if a>b:
        print(f'{a} is greater than {b}')
    else:
        print(f'{b} is greater than {a}')
        
maximum(a,b)
output:
Enter 1st number: 10
Enter 2st number: 20
20 is greater than 10

=== Code Execution Successful ===

#using lambda function
a = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
b = int(input("Enter 2st number: "))

maximum = lambda a,b: a if a>b else b

print(maximum(a,b))
ouptut:
Enter 1st number: 10
Enter 2st number: 20
20

=== Code Execution Successful ===

#using list compression
a=10
b=20
maximum = [a if a>b else b]
print(maximum)
output:
[20]

3.Python Program to Find the Factorial of a Number.
a=5
ft=1
while a>=1:
    ft = ft*a
    a-=1
    
print(ft)
output:

4.Python Program for Simple Interest.
p=100
r=10
t=12

def simpleinterest(p,r,t):
    return (p*r*t)/100
print(simpleinterest(p,r,t))
output:
120.0

5.Python Program for Compound Interest.
formula:
# A = P(1 + R/100) t 
# Compound Interest = A – P 
# where,
# A is amount 
# P is the principal amount 
# R is the rate and 
# T is the time span
p=100
r=10
t=12

def compoundinterest(p,r,t):
    a = p * (pow((1 + r/100),t))         #with using pow function
    #a = p * ((1 + r/100)**t)            #without using pow(,) function
    ci = a - p
    return ci

print(compoundinterest(p,r,t))
output:
213.8428376721003

6. Python Program to Check Armstrong Number.
a = 153
m = a
n = len(str(a))
t = 0

while a != 0:
    r = a % 10
    t = t + (r**n)
    a = a // 10

if m==t:
    print(f'{m} is an armstrong number')
else:
    print(f'{m} is not an armstrong number')
output:
153 is an armstrong number
