1. The megastore offers a deal that states any product whose price is a golden price O would be given to them for free.
A number G is said to have a given price if the difference between the highest digit and the sum of its digits equals the highest digits python program
start = int(input('Enter first number: '))
end = int(input('Enter last number:'))

def myfunc(start,end):
  l1 = []
  su = 0
  for i in range(start,end+1):
    l1 = [int(j) for j in str(i)]      #working with string number

    m = max(l1)
    s = sum(l1)
    # print(f'{l1}, Max:{m}, Sum:{s}')
    
    if s-m == m:
      print(i)
      su += i
  
  return (f'sum of digits of golden number: {su}')
  
  
print(myfunc(start,end))
output:
Enter first number: 10
Enter last number: 50
11
22
33
44
sum of digits of golden number: 110
